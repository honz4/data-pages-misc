======Salt======
Salt is a subproject included in PlantUML that may help you to design graphical interface.

You can use either @startsalt keyword, or @startuml followed by a line with
salt keyword.
======Basic widgets======
A window must start and end with brackets. You can then define:
    * Button using [ and ].
    * Radio button using ( and ).
    * Checkbox using [ and ].
    * User text area using "
<uml t="salt">
salt
{
  Just plain text
  [This is my button]
  ()  Unchecked radio
  (X) Checked radio
  []  Unchecked box
  [X] Checked box
  "Enter text here   "
  ^This is a droplist^
}
</uml>

The goal of this tool is to discuss about simple and sample windows.
======Using grid======
A table is automatically created when you use an opening bracket {.
And you have to use | to separate columns.
For example:
<uml t="salt001">
salt
{
  Login    | "MyName   "
  Password | "****     "
  [Cancel] | [  OK   ]
}
</uml>

Just after the opening bracket, you can use a character to define if you want
to draw lines or columns of the grid :

^character^lines ^
|#|To_display_all_vertical_and_horizontal_lines|
|!|To_display_all_vertical_lines               |
|-|To_display_all_horizontal_lines             |
|+|To_display_external_lines                   |
<uml t="salt002">
salt
{+
  Login    | "MyName   "
  Password | "****     "
  [Cancel] | [  OK   ]
}
</uml>

======Using separator======
You can use several horizontal lines as separator.

<uml t="salt003">
salt
{
  Text1
  ..
  "Some field"
  ==
  Note on usage
  ~~
  Another text
  --
  [Ok]
}
</uml>

======Tree widget======
To have a Tree, you have to start with {T and to use + to denote hierarchy.

<uml t="salt004">
salt
{
{T
 + World
 ++ America
 +++ Canada
 +++ USA
 ++++ New York
 ++++ Boston
 +++ Mexico
 ++ Europe
 +++ Italy
 +++ Germany
 ++++ Berlin
 ++ Africa
}
}
</uml>

======Enclosing brackets======
You can define subelements by opening a new opening bracket.

<uml t="slat005">
salt
{
Name         | "                 "
Modifiers:   | { (X) public | () default | () private | ()
protected
                [] abstract | [] final   | [] static }
Superclass:  | { "java.lang.Object " | [Browse...] }
}
</uml>

======Adding tabs======
You can add tabs using {/ notation. Note that you can use HTML code to have bold text.

<uml t="salt006">
salt
{+
{/ <b>General | Fullscreen | Behavior | Saving }
{
	{ Open image in: | ^Smart Mode^ }
	[X] Smooth images when zoomed
	[X] Confirm image deletion
	[ ] Show hidden images
}
[Close]
}
</uml>

Tab could also be vertically oriented:

<uml t="salt007">
salt
{+
{/ <b>General
Fullscreen
Behavior
Saving } |
{
	{ Open image in: | ^Smart Mode^ }
	[X] Smooth images when zoomed
	[X] Confirm image deletion
	[ ] Show hidden images
	[Close]
}
}
</uml>

======Using menu======
You can add a menu by using {* notation.

<uml t="salt008">
salt
{+
{* File | Edit | Source | Refactor }
{/ General | Fullscreen | Behavior | Saving }
{
	{ Open image in: | ^Smart Mode^ }
	[X] Smooth images when zoomed
	[X] Confirm image deletion
	[ ] Show hidden images
}
[Close]
}
</uml>

It is also possible to open a menu:

<uml t="salt_menu_open">
salt
{+
{* File | Edit | Source | Refactor
 Refactor | New | Open File | - | Close | Close All }
{/ General | Fullscreen | Behavior | Saving }
{
	{ Open image in: | ^Smart Mode^ }
	[X] Smooth images when zoomed
	[X] Confirm image deletion
	[ ] Show hidden images
}
[Close]
}
</uml>

======Advanced table======
You can use two special notations for table :
    * * to indicate that a cell with span with left
    * . to denotate an empty cell
<uml t="salt_table">
salt
{#
. | Column 2 | Column 3
Row header 1 | value 1 | value 2
Row header 2 | A long cell | *
}
</uml>

======OpenIconic======
OpenIconic is an very nice open source icon set. Those icons have been
integrated into the creole_parser, so you can use them out-of-the-box.
You can use the following syntax: **%%<&ICON_NAME>%%**.

<uml t="openiconic">
salt
{
  Login<&person> | "MyName   "
  Password<&key> | "****     "
  [Cancel <&circle-x>] | [OK <&account-login>]
}
</uml>

The complete list is available on [[http://useiconic.com/open|OpenIconic Website]], or you can use the
following special diagram:

<uml t="salt_listopeniconic">
listopeniconic
</uml>
