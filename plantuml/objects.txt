======Object Diagram======
To be able to generate those diagrams, you must have Graphviz_software
installed on your machine in the default directory c:\Program
Files\GraphvizX.XX or /usr/bin/dot.
You can have_a_look_here_if_you_have_installed_Graphviz_somewhere_else.
The description of object diagram is similar to the description of class
diagram.
======New rendering======
This page show the rendering given by the new Svek_architecture.
Note that you can disable the shadowing using the skinparam shadowing false command.
======Definition of objects======
You define instance of objects using the object keywords.
<uml t="objects" >
object firstObject
object "My Second Object" as o2
</uml>

======Relations between objects======
Relations between objects are defined using the following symbols :

^relation   ^notation ^picture ^
|Extension  |<|--|[img/extends01.png]|
|Composition|*-- |[img/sym03.png]    |
|Aggregation|o-- |[img/sym01.png]    |
It is possible to replace -- by .. to have a dotted line.
Knowing those rules, it is possible to draw the following drawings.
It is possible a add a label on the relation, using " : ", followed by the text
of the label.
For cardinality, you can use double-quotes "" on each side of the relation.
<uml t="objects2" >
object Object01
object Object02
object Object03
object Object04
object Object05
object Object06
object Object07
object Object08

Object01 <|-- Object02
Object03 *-- Object04
Object05 o-- "4" Object06
Object07 .. Object08 : some labels
</uml>

======Adding fields======
To declare fields, you can use the symbol ":" followed by the field's name.
<uml t="objects_002">

object user

user : name = "Dummy"
user : id = 123

</uml>
		
It is also possible to ground between brackets {} all fields.
<uml t="objects_003">

object user {
  name = "Dummy"
  id = 123
}

</uml>
		
======Common features with class diagrams======

    * Defines_notes
    * Use_packages
    * Title_the_diagram
    * Skin_the_output
    * Split_the_image
